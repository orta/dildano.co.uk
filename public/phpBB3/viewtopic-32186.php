		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I especially like the Guitar Hero match and the Shower match. I think the Guitar Hero match would be ideal for the Motor City Machineguns (it could be there casket match). <br /><br />And the Shower Match would be just awesome. I can just imagine a bloodied wrestler getting to the last stages of his shower, reaching to get the shower gel... REALLY SLOWLY. And then, WHAM! Spear! This should be the main event at Wrestlemania.

But I thought it would be someone like Sid Vicious or the Great Khali. <br /><br />I hope William Regal doesn't comment on his death on air, he always got his name wrong: Umanga.<br /><br />I guess the Joe vs Umaga Samoan Death Match is a no go now.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />youmanga!! My thoughts exactly Guts, I was just too emotional to write straight. Damn shame we won't see the TNA vs. WWE rip-off fight. Original gimmick vs. Plagiarised gimmick matches always sound good on paper, but they never happen. JBL vs. Million Dollar man for instance, or Abyss vs. Mankind. Where are the gimmicks these days anyway? It's all so bland. We need more gimmicks, Window Cleaner or Estate Agent or something? Or both? &quot;I'll find you somewhere with great amenities, off road parking and lots of storage. I'll make sure the windows are nice and clean, get my Removal Man tag-team partner to move you in with no hassle and then I'LL FUCK YOU UP!!&quot;

He'd be more like a barbecue chef, than the kitchen variety. Sandman had the kitchen chef covered... he used to wear the stupid trousers that they wear.<br /><br />Typical promo: ... and when I'm finished with you, you'll be bloody. And well done.<br /><br />Finishing move: The Barbecued Chickenwing.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I see AJ Styles as a bisexual Cowboy, but he'd have to be in the closet to get him over with the hicks and chicks. He could have a big coming out angle, but the main thing is that he's a cowboy. If ever a horse bolted in the arena, he'd be the one to get that horse under control. I'd say &quot;shoot from the hiptoss&quot; but that could never be a finisher. Christopher Daniels has always looked like he's aching to do some magic. He should be a sorcerer, it's great when they do the magic stuff.<br /><br />A Terry Christian impersonator would be a great heel.

For those of you reading this who are not familiar with legendary tag team &quot;The Dudley Boys&quot;, please bear in mind that there is a tag team in existence, who some would consider to be legendary, called &quot;The Dudley Boys&quot;. The fancy flushing system in question is known as the &quot;Dudley DuoFlush&quot;. This makes me chuckle.
