So I would rather drink the cockstab please.<br /><br />Would you rather, run from the shower to receive a phonecall from your sobbing mother who has just read the front page story of a local newspaper which accuses you of breaking into people's houses (particulary rest homes) and placing pornographic magazines underneath their pillows. Then the doorbell rings and it's the police and you accidentally make a racist remark and they bundle you to the ground and arrest you all naked and cold. Or have a boner for a week?

I might end up with my own Encyclopedia Dramatica page but at least I could sue the Echo.<br /><br />Would you rather...<br />a) Know a horrible secret, and be unable to do anything about it or make anyone believe you, <em>or</em><br />b) Develop paranoid schizophrenia and only think that a) is happening.
