Plus djs and a late, late bar :)<br /><br />SIX NATION STATE - <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.myspace.com/sixnationstatetheband">http://www.myspace.com/sixnationstatetheband</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Six Nation State have blown away audiences in Bournemouth, Poole and (their home town) Southampton over the last few years. Also gigs throughout Europe including a huge number of superb festival appearances have seen these guys build a fantastic reputation as a must-see band.<br /><br />Having relocated to London the band have recently reformed, and we are delighted to welcome them to Champions for NYE. Known for their passionate and lively performances, the band's energy as well as their indie-punk-ska 'get off your ass and dance' appeal make them THE perfect band to welcome in the New Year...<br /><br />TEN TO NEVER - <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.myspace.com/tentonever">http://www.myspace.com/tentonever</a><!-- m --><br /><br />With lead singer/guitarist Romin leaving Kyps &amp; heading off to a faraway land, this could quite possibly be the last ever performance from Ten To Never.<br /><br />With the band last seen performing superbly at this year's Grooves On The Green, this, for various reasons is one not to miss...<br /><br />DISCO'S OUT (MURDER'S IN) - <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.myspace.com/discooutmurdersin">http://www.myspace.com/discooutmurdersin</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Having made a huge impact on the local scene this year, DOMI are one of the most entertaining bands EVER! Fact! An rock attack of vocals, strings, drums, brass, gadgetry and all manner of headgear make this musical menagerie hugely watchable...<br /><br />DILDANO - <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.myspace.com/dildano">http://www.myspace.com/dildano</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Dildano are stars. They have 37 fans - all of whom would say Dildano are the best band EVER. And they may all be right. For fans of experimental dance punk. Legends.<br /><br />An assortment of misfits made up from members of Animal Talent Show, Sugar Ray Buzzard and the Dead legs and web/promo-types bh one will make up a PSYCHOCANDY dj posse - expect indie-ska-punk-electro-hip hop-soul PARTY CHOONS :)<br /><br />Advance tickets for this rave-up are a very generous £7, and can be purchased from Champions, or <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ticketweb.co.uk">www.ticketweb.co.uk</a><!-- w --> (link coming very soon)<br /><br />Door price is £8 before 8.30, £10 after.<br /><br />Doors 7.30pm<br />xx
