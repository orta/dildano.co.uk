Your name for instance, what's with your name? What is your address? How many colours can you name? Do you have a centre parting? Will you be attending any of the 2012 olympic events? What's wrong? Is there any way I can pay less for my mobile phone without having to change my number? What brought you to the forum? Who's your favourite wrestler? Do you work well as part of a team? Why the face? What won't meatloaf do for love? What is that? Tell us more about yourself. Or don't. Either way, welcome to the forum, feel free to write whatever you like. What do you like?

I don't plan on being a dick about which section people post in, a little healthy intermingling might avoid the Dildano forum splitting into two sub-species. Though, you know, Internets; one can devolve into a squat or sarcastic troll-like creature and back again whenever. <a href="http://jayjanner.files.wordpress.com/2009/03/sxsw-13.jpg" class="postlink">See?</a> Just a mask.<br /><br />I'm stuck on level 28 of Icebreaker. I see what you mean about Lemmings Tim, although I would venture that these Vikings are even less intelligent.
