You guess the age of a celebrity, closest wins, first to three. It's shit, but highly competitive. Did you know the Karate Kid is 48? He also has a son called Daniel.

Raping Chinese hookers and performing Martial Arts for dirty old men? Sordid.<br /><br />You haven't answered my question though Tim. I would like to know your shitting ritual (shitual?).<br /><br />I've just discovered that my place of work contains a hairdresser's. What a good waste of work time.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />My shitual:<br /><br />Announce that &quot;I'm going to Paul's&quot;, then walk around the entire Town Hall until I've found a nice enough toilet and my gut pipes have been strolled into a ready to shit state. <br /><br />Wipe the toilet seat. Pants down, phone out, sit and shit. Play &quot;Soccer 3d&quot; with ever changing strategies, made neccessary by the fact that it's the shittest and most dull game ever. My latest idea is to simply watch the first half (performing goal kicks and throw-ins when needed), in which time the opposition routinely fail to score and somehow manage to foul the good men of whichever shit team I've chosen to be. Then I play the second half and usually win about 11-2. I had the idea to shout &quot;Goal&quot; whenever I scored, but I haven't had the balls yet, although I often manage to lol at the idea which is bad enough. I could go on and on about the games on my phone but I shouldn't.<br /><br />Then I wipe my ass and enjoy the noises that the automated soap dispenser and tissue provider make. Bedoooweh AAAHP!! for soap and a sustained scream AAAAAAAAAAAAH! for tissues. Then I routinely get Alice Cooper's shit hit song &quot;Poison&quot; stuck in my head due to the Hand Dryer having a &quot;No Touch&quot; sign on it.<br /><br />&quot;I wanna touch you but I better not touch (NO TOUCH) I wanna kiss you but your lips are devil-piss poison, you're poison runnin' through my veins etc...&quot;<br /><br />That's my shitual. Anyone else?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've got Soccer 3D too. It's the most moronically poor game ever. Originally I thought it would be fun to see how many goals I could deck teams by. But it wasn't. It was soul destroying. <br /><br />My shitual is:<br /><br />I go into the local toilet and see if anyone is using either of the cubicles. If so, I leave. I keep doing this until I find it safe and quiet. I then go in the furthest away toilet cubicle and lock up. The next part depends on what shirt I'm wearing:<br /><br />If it has a pocket, I tuck my tie and pass into the pocket and unload.<br /><br />If not, I roll up my shirt forming - I believe - a makeshift kangaroo pouch within which I store my tie and pass. I then makeshit.<br /><br />For some reason I find that the toilet depths are located too far back and that my shit becomes a platter upon the ceramics. I will then attempt to attach an entire tree of toilet roll to it and try to wrench it away with a good flush. This never works. Due to the crapness of my phone's games (Soccer 3D, 3D Snake and Sudokpoo) I usually send messages or go through old messages in my sent folder to delete and reminisce whilst crapping.<br /><br />I do not leave the cubicle until there is no-one around to see me. I fear they will see what a mess I make.<br /><br />I used to hang my pass upon the jacket hook, but I left it there once and it incriminated me.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />fascinating tales there tim and gus.<br /><br />my routine (well it is not really a routine because the need to excrete can come on fast and furious at any given time)<br /><br />i am in the privileged position of having one sole toilet for the men of the building. i have developed a keen sense of whose dump is whose through pure smell. anyway i will normally open the window but the problem is directly opposite the window is another building and window where some females appear to work. if i have to stand to wipe or for any other reason there is a serious risk of being caught in the act. Im not sure if they can definetely see but the risk is a real one.<br /><br />i sometimes run the tap at the same time in the foolish hope that this will somehow prevent people hearing the noises associated with this ritual. i often wonder if people think i am having a shave.<br /><br />once the business is complete i will sometimes use the air freshener but this only masks the foul stench making perhaps a worst kind of foul stench. a perfumed turd.<br /><br />obviously i wash my hands and dry using the over excitable dryer.<br /><br />then the key to completing the mission safely is to listen at the door to see if anyone is walking past. due to the loacation of the wc there is a risk of bumping directly into someone without time to shut the door and trap in the smell behind me. <br /><br />a difficult but ultimately rewarding operation. in fact i think i may try my luck now.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />On a similar subject, but obviously intensely different in many ways (I hope). I must confess, though I wash my hands when I shit... I don't when I wee. This leads me into the very odd world of 'stage washes'. I'll explain:<br /><br />When I have a piss in a pub, I don't feel bad about not washing my hands... as hardly anyone does. In fact, the only people that do wash their hands when in a pub are those that also use the cubicle to piss. What's the point? As soon as you touch the door to leave the toilet you'll have piss on your hands again anyway.<br /><br />However, when someone comes in whilst I'm having a piss at work (in the urinal) then I feel I must pretend that I am someone that washes my hands, no matter who they are. I'm not sure why. It's not as if I go around shaking people's hands all day or handling their lunch. Therefore I either:<br /><br />a. Have a 'really long wee', which is actually code for just waiting for them to leave the toilets (which can sometimes take ages). During this I notice that they always wash their hands before leaving.<br /><br />b. Stage Wash, which only works if I'm already at the urinal and they go into the cubicle to piss (this is the preferred option if someone's already having a piss as: there's only two urinals, they're very close to each other and one of them is next to a wall that has mould growing on it due to piss splashes). When they're in there, I finish up pissing as quickly as possible and go to the sink. But I don't wash my hands. Instead, I run the tap (but don't put my hands under) and then pretend to dry them. Why I don't actually wash them, I don't know. Principle?
