		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />All I can do is sympathise. I puked at work once, for a whole day, and got paid for it. Hangovers are just awful things, especially if Jesus has anything to do with it. <br /><br />So many parties at Christmas. I had a bizarre night on Monday at the house of the head of deer conservation for the New Forest, I could go on and no doubt will elaborate someday but the point is that we got through a shitload of wine and I had a massive hangover on Tuesday morning, but it was good wine so no headache, just an awful feeling of death and doom. <br /><br />I'm more of an ibruprofen kinda guy. I think it goes through the kidneys rather than the already abused liver, and it's a painkiller so you get that slightly floaty thing going on. Caffiene provides temporary help too, but hot milky things can easily make you puke, so maybe sling yourself a Red Bull? Or lie face down in the snow for an hour then tell your boss that you have to go home because you've just been lying face down in the snow for the last hour.
