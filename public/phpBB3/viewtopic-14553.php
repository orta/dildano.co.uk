		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />That looks ace, I want a copy. I bet the section on roids is interesting, I'm sure he knows his stuff. Did you hear that story about how wwe thought he was too pumped so they said he had to take a roids test? He said he would but only if Triple H (the game, the kings of kings, the cerebral assassin) took one too. They then said fine, ok you don't have to take a roids test. <br /><br />I just went to wwe.com at work and there was a filter on it categorising it as &quot;sports&quot;. Idiots, don't they know it's sports entertainment?!? The Bournemouth TNA thing is going to feature an &quot;I Quit&quot; match. Not sure who it will involve though.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thom and I are going to see TNA in a couple of weeks. I am trying to think of some signs to make. <br /><br />There's the old classic &quot;2&quot; sign. I was considering maybe an &quot;HGH&quot; sign but this would get confiscated quickly. Also maybe a &quot;Dad?&quot; sign to confuse the more promiscuous wrestlers. Rich Hill suggested &quot;Stop stealing Vince's fossils!&quot; Which is a cracking idea.<br /><br />Any fucking suggestions?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I was considering trying to start a 'We Want Benoit' chant, but this would also work well as a sign. You should make a really 'goofy' (how long has that word been out of fashion?!?!?!?) sign like the ones you used to see in the 80s done by kids. <br /><br />Choose a really popular wrestler (AJ maybe).<br />Print on the sign: AJ<br />                         4<br />                       EVA<br />And then surround the type which pictures of AJ cut out from magazines (e.g. him jumping off the ropes, holding the belt, with his Mum, etc.)<br /><br />You'd be the coolest guy there, Tim.<br /><br />Ps. I want to take this moment to pay tribute to Tony Halme (Ludvig Borga), who has just died. Was he the greatest racist and Finnish wrestler ever? Maybe.<br /><br />Pps. Shaemus (current WWE champ) used to be the bodyguard of... Denise Van Outen. Poor guy.

Thankfully, I have just read the following:<br /><br />&quot;TNA will be using the six-sided ring on their European tour, as they have already shipped it over. &quot;
