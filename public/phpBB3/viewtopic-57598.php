		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Nice to hear from you Game.<br />With the recent news of HOGAN joining TNA, here's a very interesting comment from a certain Colbag:<br /><em><br />Hogan going to TNA spells the end of TNA. The public opinion of TNA is that it is pretty much like the dying days of WCW; most of their roster is made up of ex-WWE stars who are already a little bit past their prime; hiring a man who peaked 25 years ago, is pushing 60, can't wrestle a full time schedule, is notorious for greedy backstage politics and comes with as much baggage as Hogan isn't going to help change that perception. It also isn't going to benefit the genuine talent like AJ Styles or Abyss.</em><br /><br />Still, there may be a little chance of Hogan coming to the BIC. <br /><br />Also, ref: TNA being made up of ex WWE stars, like WCW was. There are a few that actually are the people that dragged WCW down! Namely Scott Steiner and Kevin Nash.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />...Jim Bowen did for darts?<br /><br />TNA are coming to the BIC, we got tickets a while ago, not sure if there are any left. But there have been some awesome low budget things. Jo and I had a wonderful night in the Pier Theatre (that's my boat). It was weird to have the sea beneath you when they do a bodyslam, and the very old pier theatre shakes a little. It was also not in the round - it was onstage, like a play. The local nights happen quite often though. It's really hard not to swear in front of the kids and retardids, I think Jo shouted something like &quot;Kick him in the dick&quot; or something. We've seen Bad Ass Billy Gunn in the Pavillion loads.<br /><br />Hey Gus, those were Colin's comments, I never said Hogan was past it. But he is past it and I could kick the shit out of him. If he comes to the BIC, I'll kick the shit out of him.
